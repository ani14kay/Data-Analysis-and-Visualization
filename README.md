# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

This is to explore, analyse and visualize the data of Number of Links Down over a period of 10 weeks in a certain configuration!<br><br>
So we observe and analyse different trends when the  Links were down Week-wise using Barplot, Countplot, Histplot, Scatterplot, Kdeplot, Violinplot.
Also those trends when Links were down when comparing between Weeks using Jointplot and Distplot and those when Links were down when compared throughout 
the period of 10 weeks, using Pair Plots or Grid Plots.
